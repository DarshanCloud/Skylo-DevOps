 Homework Case study- 1

 Focus area
 Cloud infra, tools and frameworks
 
 Understanding
 Consider yourself a DevOps engineer working on a project to develop a Cloud based system that
 consists of a frontend server and many different backend components. Backend services to be hosted in
 Cloud Platform. Let’s consider the following cloud infrastructure requirement:
	● Backendservice-1: Due to certain technical constraints this service need to be hosted in VM
 	● Backend service-2: This service implements customer facing REST apis and to be hosted in the kubernetes cluster.
 	● 3 more backendservices are internal microservices to be hosted in the Kubernetes cluster.
 	● Allservices are developed in Java
 	● SQL database is used and is accessed by all services
 	● Scalable deployment

 Ask from Candidates?
 	● You have been asked to provide two Environments, Develop and QA environments. Articulate
      what level of additional details are required to set up cloud infrastructure?
 	● Choose the Cloud platform of your choice (GCP, AWS, Azure or any other) and list out various
 	  cloud components and frameworks that can be used to meet above requirements. Justify the selection.
 	● How would you manage scalable deployment? What are various bottlenecks in the above case for scalability?
 	● Write Terraform/Ansible/Helm script for resource creation?
 	● How do youvalidate the created infrastructure?
 	● Discuss challenges?

 Ask from Candidates?
 	● Assume that Cloud infrastructure is created and available for hosting all services
 	● You have been asked to create a CI/CD pipeline for the project. Articulate what level of additional
      details are required for your work?
 	● List out various tools and frameworks that can be used for each part of the CI/CD. Justify the selection.
 	● Definevarious pipeline stages and how would you implement it?
 	● How the CI/CD can be managed for multiple environment (develop, QA and Production)
 	● Prepare a sample Jenkin file with all step and comments
 	● Discuss challenges?
